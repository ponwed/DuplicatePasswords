# DuplicatePasswords
This is a small .NET console app mainly created for me to try out development in VSCode and write some C#.

### Usage
The program takes a .csv file with saved password information and outputs the sites where a password has been reused. 
If you use the "Export Passwords..." function in Google Chrome you will get a .csv file with the format given in `input.example`.
